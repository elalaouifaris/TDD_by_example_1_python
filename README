This repository is a learning TDD repo based on 'TDD by Example'.

The repo contains equivalent of the books java code in Python.
The books PDF is available [here](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2003-04/W/3311/sectionM/case_studies/money/KentBeck_TDD_byexample.pdf)
I use git tags p-### to mark the commits corresponding to relevant steps in the book.
